# 🧬 Harshita.exe — A Simulation of Mind, Skill & Decisions

> “You’re not just visiting a website. You’re booting into a digital simulation — a living, evolving OS that mirrors Harshita’s mind.”

## 🌐 What is Harshita.exe?

**Harshita.exe** is a futuristic, interactive portfolio designed as a simulated operating system.  
It lets users explore not just projects, but the *thinking, failures, ethics, and evolution* behind them.

You're not a passive viewer.  
You're an **Operator** navigating the simulation.  
You’ll interact with modules, run terminal commands, experience system glitches, and challenge ethical frameworks.

## 🧠 AI Assistant: `Clarity.exe`

> “I think you're overfitting this design. Want to try a dumber idea?”

Clarity.exe is a sarcastic yet insightful GPT-powered sidekick.  
It comments, questions, and even argues with the Operator.  
Used to generate:
- GPT prompt ideas
- Ethical simulation responses
- Weird what-if redesigns of old projects
